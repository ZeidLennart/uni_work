Absolutely no proof that anything is correct. Personally, I prefer to learn by using as many code examples as possible. 
That's why I'm using the summaries from the Moodle course and going through most of the material with the examples provided there. 
The main difference is that these are coded examples that allow for hands-on experimentation. Maybe this will help someone. 
I will continue working on this throughout the next few weeks. 

* Note that the explanations in the code and the code itself are partially generated using GitHub Copilot (which, by the way, is free for students).
